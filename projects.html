                &emsp;&emsp;This is my first ever program. In my senior year of highschool, starting from
                knowing nothing about python and almost nothing about programming in general, I decided to
                learn how to code and made this in a single day. It's a simple game that called Space Raider
                where you have to avoid an asteroid that speeds up overtime, and the longer you survive, the
                higher the score you earn. Here, you can see in the video some real gameplay of the game!

                &emsp;&emsp;This is my second program that I have made, improving upon the last in both functionality
                and program complexity. It's another game just like the last, and the point of this game is to complete
                a level by making
                it from point A to B with out falling, or dying in some way. This game has much more complex features
                when compared
                to the last, here are a few:

                &emsp;&emsp;After making two programs and building a custom PC, I needed a GPU for my PC to be able to
                further develope more ambishious projects in the future. However,
                this was during the peak of the 2021 world-wide chip shortage of the pandemic, where demand for such a
                hardware component was at a record high. So I created a web scraper bot
                to autonomously monitor websites that sold the hardware component at MSRP. I learned a lot of valuable
                lessons about HTML5 along the way that eventually helped me to create this
                vrey website, but eventually after many close calls, the program suceeded twice securing two highly
                valuable GPU's (Radeon 6600xt & RTX 3060ti), where the first I resold for twice
                that of which I paid, completely covering the cost of the second.
