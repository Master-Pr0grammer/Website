                &emsp;&emsp;This is my first ever program. In my senior year of highschool, starting from
                knowing nothing about python and almost nothing about programming in general, I decided to
                learn how to code, and ended up making this in a single day. It's a simple game that I call Space Raiders
                where you have to avoid an asteroid that speeds up overtime, and the longer you survive, the
                higher the score you earn. Here, you can see in the video some real gameplay of the game!

                &emsp;&emsp;This is my second program that I have made, improving upon the last in both functionality
                and program complexity. It's another game just like the last, and the point of this game is to complete
                a level by making
                it from point A to B with out falling, or dying in some way. This game has much more complex features
                when compared

                &emsp;&emsp;After making two programs and building a custom PC, I needed a GPU for my PC to be able to
                further develop more ambitious projects in the future. However,
                this was during the peak of the 2021 world-wide chip shortage of the pandemic, where demand for such
                components were at a record high. So, I created a web scraper bot
                to autonomously monitor websites that sold the hardware component at MSRP. I learned a lot of valuable
                lessons about HTML5 along the way that eventually helped me to create this
                very website, but eventually after many close calls, the program succeeded twice securing two highly
                valuable GPU's (Radeon 6600xt & RTX 3060ti), where they were worth selling for twice that of which I paid.

                of information theory, the wordle algorithm goes through every possible guess calculating the number of average remaining words
                for each guess, and returns the words with the lowest average number of remaining words, or in other words, the words with the
                highest chance to eliminate the most remaining valid words. In simple terms, its essentually just an extremely optimized proccess 
                of elimination algorithm.

                &emsp;&emsp;This project is an implementation of a fully connected artificial neural
                network completely from scratch with the exception of the use of NumPy in order to
                speed up CPU-bound matrix calculations. Functionally, at its base level, it works the similarly as pytorch with
                the ability to define layers, and combine them together to create a network. 
            </p>

            <p class="indent">
                &emsp;&emsp;When you create a new network, it allows you to define the general structure of a neural
                network as a list of numbers where each element is a layer, and the value of each element is 
                the number of neurons in that layer. This is the default functionality, however internally, it represents
                the network as a list of layer objects, so you can manually create a network like pytorch has it implemented.
                As for the training, again it has the same functionality as Pytorch, but there is a default function that
                can be used to handle all of the training with one function call. This again can alternatively also be done manually
                for more control.

            <p class="indent">
                &emsp;&emsp;This was somewhat of a continuation of my last project, in this project I generate a video representation
                of an AI learning an image, in the example above it's a simple smiley face, but it can be anything. The video is generated
                by sampling an image from the AI after every training step, then at the end of the training stringing the sampled images
                together to create a video. So you're literally watching an AI learn. 
            </p>

            <p class="indent">
                &emsp;&emsp;Originally, I had used my own code to create the neural network behind the AI, but due to the fact that it was
                CPU-bound proved to be much too slow, so after the original implementation, I opted to use PyTorch instead so that the Training could
                benefit from GPU powered acceleration via highly parallelized processing.
